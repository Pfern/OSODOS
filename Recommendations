ACADEMY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA REPRODUCIBILITY

Design rigorous and comprehensive evaluation criteria to recognize and
reward high-quality scientific research.

Require universal training in good scientific practices, appropriate statistical
usage, and responsible research practices for scientists at all levels, with
training content regularly updated and presented by qualified scientists.

Establish open data as the standard operating procedure throughout the
scientific enterprise.

Encourage scientific journals to publish negative data that meet
standards of quality.

Agree upon common criteria among scientific journals for retraction
of published papers, to provide consistency and transparency.

Strengthen research integrity oversight and training.
