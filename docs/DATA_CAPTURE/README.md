This module will show you ways to ensure that capturing data operations will produce reliable records
=====================================================================================================

Capturing data in a laboratory is a dayly operation that easily falls in routine chores. Something 
that can be a way to pile-up habits, both good and bad. Good data capture habits result in organised 
datasets in which one can find the means to reconstruct the capture itself, identify the instruments 
that were used, the reactants, the people intervening, etc. Fora a scientist, even if working alone, 
good datasets are an assurance that his/her attitude towards a rigorous relationship with the experiments 
started correctly. To the questions *Where*, *when* and *how*  (WWH) did you get yor data, one can exect to be 
able to answer unequivocally.

It is relatively easy to produce and accumulate bad records and store bad datasets that have little 
or zero scientific value. Apparently good practices like keeping a lab-book, usually mandatory nowadays, 
are NOT a guarantee that experiments are properly recorded into datasets that allow anyone, including
the original researcher, to fully address the WWH questions, to start with. For example, a bad habit 
that apparently looks good is to record data in spreadsheets, occasionally print parts of spreadsheets on 
paper and glue tables in the lab-book. Easily the WWH questions become unanserable, the content of such a 
table becomes artificially dependent from other recorded information in the lab-book but it easily detaches 
from it with a simple annotation mistake. Highly dangerous, yet quite common practice. Worse than just 
being bad, it can "look" good!
