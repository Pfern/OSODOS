## Data provenance

Provenance in data is tied not only to data collection act but also to its further movements between databases. 
Provenance may or not entail ownership and licensing of its use. If the appropriate steps are taken, authenticated 
provenance implies authorship. To dig further, [[Buneman2000](REFERENCES#Buneman2000)] is an interesting document 
about data provenance.
