Reproducibility is a basic requirement of any scientific endeavour. An experiment is simply invalid if, when replicated, 
does not produce the same set of results or least an approximate set of results. Anybody, in the same conditions, should 
be able to follow specifications and reproduce experiments and results. Likewise, experiments shound be robust and perform
 equally well, independently of the observer.

Currently (2016-2017) there is a declared reproducibility crisis. In the biomedical area, attempts to reproduce experiments 
with cancer cells, for example, have repostedly failed. In consequence, some papers had to be retracted. Several efforts have
 been put in place to provide systematic reproduction of experiments at various scales at the level of core facilities, 
laboratories, research institutes, universities and service providers. Since 2012, an international initiative is in place 
to make it happen in a systematic way http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/08/14/plos-one-launches-reproducibility-initiative/

The end result is that scientists became much more concerned about reproducibilty and tightened their controls. Scientific 
societies have studied ways of figthing the lack of reproducibility and issued recommendations (see, for example, 
https://www.asm.org/index.php/colloquium-reports/item/4510-promoting-responsible-scientific-research). Within the 
recommendation, training is clearly a priority, at various levels.
