Reproducibility is a basic requirement of any scientific endeavour. An experiment is simply invalid if, when replicated, does not produce the same set of results or least an approximate set of results. Anybody, in the same conditions, should be able to follow specifications and reproduce experiments and results. Likewise, experiments shound be robust and perform equally well, independently of the observer.

Currently (2016-2017) there is a declared reproducibility crisis. In the biomedical area, attempts to reproduce experiments with cancer cells, for example, have repostedly failed. In consequence, some papers had to be retracted. Several efforts have been put in place to provide systematic reproduction of experiments at various scales at the level of core facilities, laboratories, research institutes, universities and service providers. An ongoing international initiative is in place to make it happen in a systematic way http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/08/14/plos-one-launches-reproducibility-initiative/.
