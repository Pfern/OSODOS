Reproducibility is a basic requirement of any scientific endeavour. An experiment is simply invalid if, when replicated, does not produce the same set of results or least an approximate set of results. Anybody, in the same conditions, should be able to follow specifications and reproduce experiments and results. Likewise, experiments shound be robust and perform equally well, independently of the observer.

In consequence, some papers had to be retracted. Several efforts have been put in place to start systematic reproduction of experiments at various scales (see for example
