How to publish a scientific article that gets read
==================================================
Elsewhere in these materials we discuss technological solutions and logical
principles for [how to study the scientific literature](../LITERATURE_STUDY) and 
[how to edit and revise a manuscript](../VERSIONING) collaboratively. The next
challenges will be to write something good and publish it such that it is most
likely to be read, cited, and otherwise recognised. Scientific writing is both
a creative exercise in logical exposition and rhetoric as well as a highly rigid
following of established rules for document structure and jargon usage. Practice
makes perfect, but here are some potentially useful guidelines:

The scholarly publishing cycle
------------------------------
Assuming you have figured out a way to work with your collaborators to draft a manuscript
into a state you all agree is ready to be sent out into the world, the next question is then
where it will go. It is becoming increasingly common in more and more of the natural sciences
to send a manusript to a [preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) server. This will
be the first version that is identifiable on the web and that will likely be assigned a 
[digital object identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) or DOI.

Subsequently, you might submit your manuscript for peer review, and, finally, for publication
in a journal. The review cycle will result in more "private" versions of your manuscript:
versions that are annotated by the reviewers, versions by your collaborators to address the
reviewer comments, a version that you send back to the editor. This might happen multiple 
times. Finally, upon acceptance, you will be sent page proofs to correct (to make sure 
the manuscript will look correct in print). You will then sent back that version with any
required corrections, and then the manuscript will be "actually" published.

If you uploaded an earlier version to a preprint server, you will now need to make sure that
people using the DOI of that preprint version will be able to locate the "final" version.
This might mean that the record on the preprint server will need to be updated to point to
the "final" DOI. The cumbersome nature of the scholarly publishing cycle, with potentially 
many versions floating around on cloud services, preprint servers, indexing databases and
publisher websites, demonstrates the need for clear, unambiguous, globally unique 
identifiability of manuscripts. The DOI was invented for this purpose, and tools such as
reference managers (e.g. Mendeley) make use of it to locate the "correct" metadata associated
with this article. The most important of these metadata is Your Name, because only if you are
also uniquely identifiable will you get credited (e.g. cited) for your work (this is one of
the reasons why systems such as [ORCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID) are in usage).
