How to publish a scientific article that gets read
==================================================
Elsewhere in these materials we discuss technological solutions and logical
principles for [how to study the scientific literature](../LITERATURE_STUDY) and 
[how to edit and revise a manuscript](../VERSIONING) collaboratively. The next
challenges will be to write something good and publish it such that it is most
likely to be read, cited, and otherwise recognised. Scientific writing is both
a creative exercise in logical exposition and rhetoric as well as a highly rigid
following of established rules for document structure and jargon usage. Practice
makes perfect, but here are some potentially useful guidelines:

The scholarly publishing cycle
------------------------------
**Preprints** - Assuming you have managed to draft a manuscript collaboratively 
into a state you all agree is ready to be sent out into the world, the next 
question is then where it will go. As the chart below shows, it is becoming 
increasingly common (and in more and more of the natural sciences) to send a 
manuscript to a 
[preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) server, such as 
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org), [PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/),
and [biorXiv](http://biorxiv.org).

When you upload your manuscript to such a server, it will not be type set - so 
this is your chance to make a pretty PDF. What may happen is that a human on the 
other end will do some checks to see if what you uploaded is indeed a scholarly 
manuscript and that you have the right to post there (i.e. it is not
copyrighted somehow), but it will not be peer reviewed. What, then, is the
purpose of this? Here is an [introductory video](https://youtu.be/2zMgY8Dx9co)
created by [asapbio](http://asapbio.org/), _a scientist-driven initiative to 
promote the productive use of preprints in the life sciences._

Your preprint will be the first version of your manuscript that is publicly 
accessible and uniquely identifiable to anyone on the web. It will likely be 
assigned a [digital object identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) 
or DOI.

**Peer review** Subsequent to, perhaps, an upload to a preprint sever, you will 
submit your manuscript for peer review and publication in a journal. During this
process you will most likely:

1. Prepare and upload a package that consists of your manuscript (double-spaced, 
   with line numbers), the illustrations and any supplementary data in separate 
   files, and a cover letter where you explain to the editor the importance of 
   your manuscript for the readership of the journal you are targeting.
2. Receive reviews where two or more, usually anonymous, colleagues give 
   feedback on your manuscript. This is usually at least one page per reviewer,
   consisting of remarks on the substance of your work as well as nitpicking
   about typos, phrasing, things you really ought to cite, and so on. These
   reviews will be accompanied by an editorial decision. The best you can 
   reasonably hope for is _accept with minor revisions_, which means you 
   probably will not have to do additional experiments or analysis, just 
   rewriting. _Major revisions_ means more work, which therefore means it will
   take a lot longer for the manuscript to be finally published. Because 
   publishers want to avoid showing a long timespan between initial submission 
   and publication (this is usually somewhere on the first page of an article) 
   it appears to become more common to get _reject with resubmission_
   instead, which also means more work and a "reset" on the ticking clock from
   the publishers perspective. Most disheartening of all is a rejection where
   the editor does not want to see this manuscript resubmitted again. This is
   usually simply because your manuscript was not appropriate for that journal.
3. Draft your response to the reviewers and revise your manuscript. You should
   respond somehow to all of the remarks made by the reviewers. Sometimes the
   remarks will genuinely be helpful and improve your manuscript. Anything 
   trivial requested by a reviewer you should just do outright so that you build 
   up some credit with the final arbiter, the editor, for the parts where you 
   may have to argue or refuse to do something: reviewers can be wrong, or 
   unreasonable, so you might not be able to satisfy them in every respect.
4. After one or more rounds of review, receive the final verdict. If it was 
   accepted, you will then receive page proofs that you will need to check very
   carefully, because this is how your paper will look in print. You will return
   the annotated page proofs, and, perhaps, a signed statement where you 
   transfer copyright to the publisher. Also, you will most likely have to pay:
   for colour figures and other expenses associated with making a "pretty" 
   publication, but possibly also for "open access", which is discussed in more
   detail in the next section.

About citations and other metrics
---------------------------------
Once your article is published, and if you uploaded an earlier version to a 
preprint server, you will now need to make sure that people using the DOI of 
that preprint version will be able to locate the "final" version. This might 
mean that the record on the preprint server will need to be updated to point to
the "final" DOI. The cumbersome nature of the scholarly publishing cycle, with potentially 
many versions floating around on cloud services, preprint servers, indexing databases and
publisher websites, demonstrates the need for clear, unambiguous, globally unique 
identifiability of manuscripts. The DOI was invented for this purpose, and tools such as
reference managers (e.g. Mendeley) make use of it to locate the "correct" metadata associated
with this article. The most important of these metadata is Your Name, because only if you are
also uniquely identifiable will you get credited (e.g. cited) for your work (this is one of
the reasons why systems such as [ORCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID) are in usage).
