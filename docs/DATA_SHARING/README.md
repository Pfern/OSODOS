Data Sharing in the scientific community
========================================
Collaboration is a natural, essential element in research. Sharing of resources amongst scientists should be a lot easier than it is, as it finds expected and unexpected barriers everywhere. It is also natural to expect that the more abstract objects are the easier it is to share them, at least on the technical aspects, size, costs, etc. Sharing data to enable collaboration is a path that you might like to start exploring by using some guidance and the one that can be found here:

This article will equip you with ideas about sharing data in various types of environments, considering the concerns that emerge from mixing different policies and resulting restrictions. Standards, databases, policies about data sharing are quite comprehensively compiled by the BioSharing team at https://biosharing.org/

Choosing a platform
-------------------
In what concerns platforms to share various types of data, a researcher has access to a reasonable amount of choice. At present (June 2017), we invite you to explore a number of repositories. Often they are complemented with a series of services that offer some specific advantages, such las linking to publications, providing licensing options, offering digital object identifiers (DOI) They differ quite considerably in their policies, level of curation and organization methods. Specificity also occurs in the case of repositiories orienteed towards certain communities of users. Such is the case of digital libraries, for example.

- **Dryad Digital Repository** "The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes." http://datadryad.org/

- **FigShare** "As governments and funders of research see the benefit of open content, the creation of recommendations, mandates and enforcement of mandates are coming thick and fast. figshare has always led the way in enabling academics, publishers and institutions to easily adhere to these principles in the most intuitive and efficient manner." Mark Hahnel, Founder and CEO, figshare https://figshare.com/

General list of repositories
----------------------------
Nature publishes an online resource at https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories that points to a large variety of data repositories.

Licensing, Attribution and Openness in Data Repositories
--------------------------------------------------------
Data made available via open repositories enables a series of attractive opportunities for researchers. First, the opportunity for attaching an attribution to the work of capturing, storing and curating data. Credit is assigned to the depositor following well established and understod rules, in general one of the variants of the Creative Commons licensing scheme https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ 

Data sharing in this way also enables reuse and, in particular, reprocessing. This exposure of data to other resarchers, students and the public is gaining popularity. It is obvious that others may find more from the same data by using different tools with different parameter settings and options, and it is interesting to observe that it can be used preserving attribution. On the other hand, the opportunities that arise when combining heterogeneous datasets may allow for important steps that would be much more difficult otherwise.
