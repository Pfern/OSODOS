Data Sharing in the scientific community
========================================
Collaboration is a natural, essential element in research. Sharing of resources amongst scientists should be a lot easier than it is, as it finds expected and unexpected barriers everywhere. It is also natural to expect that the more abstract objects are the easier it is to share them, at least on the technical aspects, size, costs, etc. Sharing data to enable collaboration across disparate locations is a path that you might like to start exploring by using some guidance, e.g. as outlined in [[Boland2017](../REFERENCES#Boland2017)].

This article will equip you with ideas about sharing data in various types of environments, considering the concerns that emerge from mixing different policies and resulting restrictions. Standards, databases, policies about data sharing are quite comprehensively compiled by the BioSharing team at https://biosharing.org/

Depositing result data
----------------------

### Generic data repositories
In what concerns platforms to share various types of data, a researcher has access to a reasonable amount of choice. At present (August 2017), we invite you to explore a number of repositories. Often they are complemented with a series of services that offer some specific advantages, such as linking to publications, providing licensing options, offering digital object identifiers (DOI). They differ quite considerably in their policies, level of curation and organization methods. Specificity also occurs in the case of repositiories orientated towards certain communities of users. Such is the case of digital libraries, for example.

- **Dryad Digital Repository** "The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes." http://datadryad.org/

- **FigShare** "As governments and funders of research see the benefit of open content, the creation of recommendations, mandates and enforcement of mandates are coming thick and fast. figshare has always led the way in enabling academics, publishers and institutions to easily adhere to these principles in the most intuitive and efficient manner." Mark Hahnel, Founder and CEO, figshare https://figshare.com/

- **Zenodo** "Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators." https://zenodo.org/

- **Dataverse** "Dataverse is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data. It facilitates making data available to others, and allows you to replicate others' work more easily. Researchers, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive academic credit and web visibility." https://dataverse.org/

### Domain-specific repositories
In addition to the generic data repositories listed above, a very large number of domain-specific data repositories and databases exists. Such repositories accept specific data types - for example, DNA sequences - that need to be provided in specific formats and with specific metadata. This means that, probably, not all different data and results generated by a research project can be uploaded to the same repository, and that uploading is sometimes cumbersome and complicated. On the other hand domain-specific repositories can provide more services tailored to a specific data type (such as BLAST searching of uploaded DNA sequences). Nature publishes an [online list](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories) of a large variety of data repositories, while [re3data](http://www.re3data.org/) provides a searchable database of repositories.

Licensing, Attribution and Openness in Data Repositories
--------------------------------------------------------
Data made available via open repositories enables a series of attractive opportunities for researchers. First, the opportunity for attaching an attribution to the work of capturing, storing and curating data. Credit is assigned to the depositor following well established and understod rules, in general one of the variants of the Creative Commons licensing scheme https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ 

Data sharing in this way also enables reuse and, in particular, reprocessing. This exposure of data to other resarchers, students and the public is gaining popularity. It is obvious that others may find more from the same data by using different tools with different parameter settings and options, and it is interesting to observe that it can be used preserving attribution. On the other hand, the opportunities that arise when combining heterogeneous datasets may allow for important steps that would be much more difficult otherwise.
