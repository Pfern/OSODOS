Data Management
===============

Anyone handling data should be aware of the need to manage it. There are risks of loss or corruption, there is growth, there is the 
possible need to share, there is attribution, etc.

The need for data management and the need to create plans
---------------------------------------------------------
There are several reasons why one should think that data from one or many projects can easily be at risk if not managed properly. Naturally the need to manage data is reduced if the volume of data is low, but it is also true that even small volumes of data that go unmanaged cause serious problems when there is a loss of any kind. Research Funding agencies began to ask for a data management plan in the grant applications. This has obliged researchers to at least get informed, but it is quite clear that training provision in this area is far below the present and foreseeable levels of demand.

Dta from research projects
--------------------------
Research projects generate enormous quantities of data, every single day. In many cases it is clear that raw, unprocessed data should be kept, but in many others it is not adequate at all. In large scale sequencing, but also in radio astronomy and particle physics, for example, the volumes of raw data are often enormous and their permanent storage is unreasonable. Performing the sequence again may be a lot more adequate, if the ned arises.

Permanent, long term data storage requires tailored stategical decision-maling. What to store, when, where and how it is backed-up. The availability of cloud resources, where there is a physical distribution of the storage servers has brought very considerable benefits in this area. But that is the technical side of it. Often harder is the management of a team of people involved in the progress of the same project. The need for a frequently updated guided process, that takes into considerations that people exhibit very different ways of thinking, not always in the best structured way, calls for plans that are goal-directed yet very adaptable to a wide range of circumstances.

Getting to know how to write a Data Management Plan
---------------------------------------------------
One possible way to make some progress in increasing one's capabilities for writing data management plans is to look at well built examples to get inspired. 
No single plan will suit everyone's needs, but it is common practice to use a good one as a seed and modify it to one's needs.

You can find some good examples here: http://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management-plans/data-management-plan-examples

Browsing though several of these you will discover ideas that fit your requirements, here and there.

Online training on Data Managemet Plans
---------------------------------------
A suitable alternative can be acquiring some online training via a simple web-based tutorial on Data Management Plans, such as this one from PennState University:

Specific issues with sensitive data
-----------------------------------
Particularly acute cases arise when we speak about sensitive data, as for example in data management plans that involve patient data, even when there is informed consent. It is not always obvious but human genetic data consisting only of stretches of sequence from a single human sample may be sufficient to uniquely identify a person. This could even be considered good, were it not for the fact that it may be used to violate individual privacy in ways that do not protect citizens.
