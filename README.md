OSODOS: Open Science, Open Data and Open Source
===============================================

Description 
-----------

In an age of increasingly complex and data-intensive, collaborative scientific practices, scandals of irreproducibility, and a growing societal ethos of transparency and accountability, a new paradigm has arisen: Open Science. In this three day course, we will introduce to you the three organizing principles and practices that undergird this paradigm:

- Open Access scholarly publishing
- Open Source software development
- Open Data integration and sharing

To support each of these, numerous technologies exist, which we will introduce to you. The case we will work on is going to be based on bioinformatics, but the principles are broadly applicable. You do not need to have any particular programming or otherwise computational experience beyond what is normally required of a scientist in graduate school and beyond, i.e., you should not be afraid of the computer and be able to edit text files.
