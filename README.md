OSODOS: Open Science, Open Data and Open Source
===============================================
In an age of increasingly complex and data-intensive, collaborative scientific practices, scandals of irreproducibility, and a growing societal ethos of transparency and accountability, a new paradigm has arisen: Open Science. In this repository, we have collected materials and written prose touching on the following topics:

- Open Access scholarly publishing
- Open Source software development
- Open Data integration and sharing

These materials are intended to be freely disseminated as an e-book and/or a [website](https://pfern.github.io/OSODOS/).
